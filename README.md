A very simple app that uses google book api to find books.You can find books using title,author,or genre.You would need a google api key to run it.\
First go index.js and put your Google API key in "key" variable as string then type the following command in terminal while being in the same directory as the app

nodemon index.js

Then type the following url in a browser
